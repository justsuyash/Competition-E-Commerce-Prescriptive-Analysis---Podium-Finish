# Competition-E-Commerce-Prescriptive-Analysis---Podium-Finish

This is a UTD competition notebook, we had a week to learn tableau and we did a podium finish.

Data is taken from : https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

Python File is where we did our EDA some things looked that they could serve us some things looks like they are useless. Plotly graphs are not visible, however I encourage
you to download notebook and check out and practice the plotly graphs. :)

After the EDA we did some Statistical Analysis in R and then Provided our recommendations  in Tableau.
